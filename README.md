## Digit Classification Using TensorFlow Neural Network

# This project demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to train a neural network for digit classification. The goal of this project is to correctly classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project is implemented in Google Colab, which provides a cloud-based environment for running Jupyter notebooks with GPU acceleration.
Usage



Files

    DigitsClassificationipynb.ipynb: This is the Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project.
    README.md: This file. It provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the notebook in Google Colab.

Requirements

The notebook requires the following software to be installed:

    Python 3.7 or later
    TensorFlow 2.0 or later
    NumPy

Google Colab provides a Python environment with these libraries already installed, so you don't need to install them separately. However, if you want to run the notebook on your own machine, you will need to install these libraries manually.
